# Old Project Dump I Use For Reference

Hello. My friends call me Aya. If you've received this link then you're either someone interested in what my skillset looks like, or you're a friend looking for reference code. I hope this information is helpful to you in some sense. I consider a lot of the repositories here extremely amateur, though they were necessary for my learning process (I have no real study skills).

I enjoy buns of many varieties, and I hope that you do too.
